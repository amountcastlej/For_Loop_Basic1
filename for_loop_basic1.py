# 1. print all integers from 0 to 150
#for i in range(0, 151):
#    print(i)

#2. print all multiples of 5 from 5 to 1000
# create a for loop that gives all multiple of 5
#for i in range(5, 1001, 5):
#    print(i)

#3. Counting, the Dojo Way 
# Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo"
# create a for loop that prints 1 to 100
# create condition that if divides into 5 evenly print "Coding"
# create condition that if divides into 10 evenly print "Coding Dojo"
#for i in range(1, 101):
#    if i % 5 == 0:
#        print("Coding")
#    elif i % 10 == 0:
#        print("Coding Dojo")
#    else: 
#        print(i)

#4. Whoa. That Sucker's Huge
# Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum
# create a variable for odd numbers
# create a for loop that prints 0 to 500,000
# create condition that if odd add it to variable to hold odd numbers
# Get the total of odd numbers and print the variable that holds the sum
# oddTotal = 0
# for i in range(0, 500000):
#     if i % 2 == 1:
#         oddTotal += i
#     print(oddTotal)

#5. Countdown by Fours
# Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting by fours
# create a for loop 
# start range at 2018, stop at 0, and subtract by 4 each time
#for i in range(2018, 0, -4):
#    print(i)

#6. Flexible Counter 
# Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, multi
# Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are multiple of mult
# create variables lowNum, highNum, mult and assign integers to each
# Use a for loop to check if mult is divisible by the numbers
# If values are a multiple of mult aka 3 then print

# lowNum = 2
# highNum = 9
# mult = 3

# for num in range(lowNum, highNum + 1): 
#     if num % mult == 0:
#         print(num)
